# Privacy Policy for Drifty Pro

*Last Updated: September 18, 2025*

## Introduction

Micu Florin Valentin ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Drifty Pro mobile application ("the App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.

Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

Drifty Pro is designed with your privacy in mind. We DO NOT collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identification information
- Contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Health or medical data
- Any user-generated content

### Local Data Storage

All your preferences and settings within Drifty Pro are stored locally on your device only. This includes:
- Vibration pattern preferences
- Intensity settings
- Timer preferences
- Any customization settings

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## How We Use Information

Since Drifty Pro does not collect any personal information, we do not use any personal data. The App operates entirely on your device without requiring any data transmission to external servers.

## Data Security

Your data security is important to us. Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- We have no access to your data
- Your data is protected by your device's security measures
- Deleting the App will remove all associated data from your device

## Third-Party Services

### Payment Processing

Drifty Pro uses Apple's In-App Purchase system for subscription management. When you make a purchase:
- The transaction is processed entirely by Apple
- We do not have access to your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy applies to payment transactions: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

### No Analytics or Tracking

Drifty Pro does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Children's Privacy

Drifty Pro is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no personal information for you to:
- Access
- Correct
- Delete
- Port to another service

All your App data is already under your complete control on your device.

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since Drifty Pro does not collect, sell, or share any personal information, these rights are automatically respected.

## European Privacy Rights

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not collect any personal data, we inherently comply with GDPR requirements.

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data retention policy needed. All App-related data on your device is removed when you uninstall the App.

## International Data Transfers

Drifty Pro does not transfer any data internationally because no data is collected or transmitted from your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Changes are effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## Do Not Track Signals

Drifty Pro does not track users, so Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals are inherently respected.
